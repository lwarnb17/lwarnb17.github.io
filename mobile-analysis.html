            <h1>Mobile Browsing - Analysis </h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>I was asked for this assignment to keep track of websites for 24 hours just using my mobile device.
            I discovered that this was harder than expected, but not as bad as I thought it would be. </p>

            <h2>Questions to consider:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can you still see what you want to see?</li>
                <li>Can you find what you're looking for?</li>
                <li>Can you do what you want to do?</li>
                <li>Any frustrations?</li>
                <li>Anything work better on the small screen?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <h3>Can you still see what you want to see?</h3>
            <p>Yes, you can it. Google is my go to search engine on my phone. I am impressed at how well it displays on my phone.</p>

            <h3>Can you find what you're looking for?</h3>
            <p>On my banking webiste I was able to find what I needed but it was very hard to see. It did not shrink to fit my screen.</p>

            <h3>Can you do what you want to do?</h3>
            <p>On my phone I always use hotmail through google rather than download a mail app. I am always able to do what I need to do. I find it no more difficult on my phone than on my laptop. </p>

            <h3>Any frustrations?</h3>
            <p>I was frustrated with my banking webiste. It made it very hard to see what I was doing.</p>

            <h3>Anything work better on the small screen?</h3>
            <p>Iwent on to LDS.org to find a talk. I did not mind how it looked when I pulled the website up. It looked just as good on my phone that it does when I pull it up on my computer. </p>


            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I was taught that some websites are very prepared for mobile browsing and others not so much. With how much people use their phones you would think that websites would want to be mobile friendly.</p>

            <h2>List of sites</h2>
            <!-- list out the sites you used as examples above.  The href="" portion is where you will put the URL to the site.  In between the <a></a> is where you will put the clickable text the use will see.  The first link to Google is given as an example...you should change it to one of your links. -->
