<h2>Purpose of Site</h2>
<p>My brother is hoping to start his own aerial spraying business. I wanted to create a webiste for him so that<br>
he can advertise on the web. Customers would be able to get on and see what services he provides and where he flies.<br>
I will also show his experience and the planes that he flies as well </p>

<h3>The web pages</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Home Page: Here I will show the home page of his business. Logo, nav bar, mission statement.</li>
        <li>Services Provided: I will list all of things that he provides. Fertilizers, cover crops, herbicides,<br>
            mapping services </li>
        <li>Crew: I will give a bio on Ty and other crew members. The flight hours that they have and the planes they fly.</li>
        <li>Location: I will say where the flight strip is located along with the areas that they service.<br> I might provide a map as well on this page.</li>
        <li>Contact: On this page I will include my brother's contact information so that farmers can contact him for work.</li>

    </ul>
