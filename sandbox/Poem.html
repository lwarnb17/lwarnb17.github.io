            <p> One night I dreamed a dream.<br>
                As I was walking along the beach with my Lord. <br>
                Across the dark sky flashed scenes from my life.<br>
                For each scene, I noticed two sets of footprints in the sand,<br>
                One belonging to me and one to my Lord.<br>
                After the last scene of my life flashed before me,<br>
                I looked back at the footprints in the sand.<br>
                I noticed that at many times along the path of my life,<br>
                especially at the very lowest and saddest times,<br>
                there was only one set of footprints.<br>
                This really troubled me, so I asked the Lord about it.<br>
                "Lord, you said once I decided to follow you,<br>
                You'd walk with me all the way.<br>
                But I noticed that during the saddest and most troublesome times of my life,<br>
                there was only one set of footprints.<br>
                I don't understand why, when I needed You the most, You would leave me."<br>
                He whispered, "My precious child, I love you and will never leave you<br>
                Never, ever, during your trials and testings.<br>
                When you saw only one set of footprints,<br>
                It was then that I carried you." </p>
