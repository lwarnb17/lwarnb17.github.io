        <h1>Mobile Weather App Site Plan</h1>

        <nav><a href="/index.html">Home</a> </nav>


        <h2>Purpose</h2>

        <p>The client would like a web based weather app created. The purpose of the site is to give<br>
            current weather conditions in 3 different ways.  The initial landing page will give the<br>
            weather for the current location based on the Geocoding information given by the browser.<br>
            The second is weather for 3 specific locations accessible through a dedicated link, and the<br>
            third is weather for any location determined by a search string.</p>


        <h2>Audience</h2>

        <p>
            Primary audience is adults ages 18-30.  Most will be students.  Access to the site will be split<br>
            between mobile devices and laptops.
        </p>


        <h3>Audience Goals: </h3>

        <p>College students move around quite a bit so one goal would be to quickly get the weather<br>
        conditions for their current location as they head off to class or study. They are also often<br>
        far from their homes so the ability to quickly get the conditions for a specific location is<br>
        important as well.  The third goal deals with planning for travels...the ability to get weather<br>
        conditions for any location will help with last minute packing for road trips.
        </p>

        <h4>Personas</h4>

        <img src="/weather/plan-images/cool-joe.jpg" alt="Snoopy">


        <ul>
            <li><strong>Name:</strong> Joe Cool</li>
            <li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Student</li>
            <li><strong>Age:</strong> Undetermined</li>
            <li><strong>Intersts:</strong> Traveling, seeing new things </li>
            <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Joe is not into planning.  His last minute scrambling, whether it<br>
                is getting to class in the morning or heading out on his latest adventure, has<br>
                left him unprepared for weather conditions many times (He is tired of<br>
                sleeping in the rain and snow).  He would like to be more prepared...without having<br>
                to put much effort into it...or planning.</li>
            <li><strong>Enviroment:</strong> Joe is comfortable using laptops and Mobile devices, he will<br>
                most often be found on a smart phone however.  Many of the places he frequents<br>
                do not have great signal…he is often dealing with 3G speeds</li>
        </ul>


        <img src="/weather/plan-images/lucy.jpg" alt="Lucy">

        <ul>

            <li><strong>Age:</strong> 18</li>
            <li><strong>Intersts:</strong> Giving advice, Psychology </li>
            <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Lucy is a no nonsense young lady who likes to help those<br>
                around her. She wants easy access to the weather conditions for many<br>
                locations so that she can always be prepared to offer some unsolicited<br>
                advice to her peers. </li>
            <li><strong>Enviroment:</strong> Lucy has a smart phone that she uses to keep her eye <br>
                on her social media ‘friends’.  She is usually not very far from her trusty laptop<br>
                however. Most of her time online is spent either on the University network<br>
                or the apartment broadband.</li>
        </ul>
